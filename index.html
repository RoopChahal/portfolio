        My hobby is reading interesting books
            that are fun to read and to learn vocabulary.My favorite types of books are storybooks.Whenever I have time,I read about 15-25 minutes a day so it can sharpen my brain.While I read,I picture what is happening in a book.You can become more successful in life if you read a lot of books and gain knowledge.You can also get a very good job like,doctor,lawyer,etc.Reading books is very important.I hope that I can be very successful in life by reading books.
